## Installation

1. `docker-compose up -d`
    - Starts up the database as a Docker container

    - CREWVITY_API_KEY: can be obtained from "Settings" after logging in from [Crewvity.com](https://crewvity.com)

## Setting up example strategies
We need to link the strategy variants defined in this trading bot with the strategies that are registered in [Crewvity](https://crewvity.com).

1. Login to [Crewvity](https://crewvity.com)
1. Add three strategies with below names and get their strategy IDs
    - MacCross-BTC-Fast
    - MacCross-BTC-Medium
    - MacCross-BTC-Slow
1. Paste the crewvity strategy IDs into [add-strategy.ts](src/cli-command/strategy/add-strategy.ts)
1. Run the script with `yarn cmd add-strategy` from the root folder
1. Run the server `yarn start:dev` and strategies should initialise and start running automatically

[add-strategy.ts](src/cli-command/strategy/add-strategy.ts) script here is a [NestJS Commander](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/nest-commander) script.

## Modules
Entire codebase is organised by [NestJS Modules](https://docs.nestjs.com/modules), each responsible for a specific domain.
- cli-command: all [NestJS Commander](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/nest-commander) scripts
- commons: any commonly shared code across all other modules
- crewvity: integration with [Crewvity API](https://crewvity-production.up.railway.app/api)
- database: integration with database. All TypeORM entities should be defined here.
- market-data: market data provider for all the tradable assets
- strategy: manages all trading bot strategies
